King Khan is a discord bot - custom made for moderation, and carries out automated functions.

  - Kick/Ban/Warn members with simple commands
  - Logs all messages into a database
  - Has links to my gamertags and social media if you want to connect!

# Purpose
> I wanted to learn how applications are made
> and I decided the best way to do that was
> by making my own! I wanted to create a
> Discord BOT for my server as it continues to grow
> and more and more members join my community!
> =====================================
> The purpose of this discord bot was to help
> facilitate moderation of this server and allow
> users to connect with me whether it be various
> social media or gaming platforms.
> This Discord BOT is currently running on
> Amazon Web Services using EC2. The BOT also
> uses google firebase to log every message.

### Installation

King Khan BOT is currently running on v1.0.0 and is not made for public use. 
It is a private bot for my server!

If you would like to use my code and test it out, you would need a few libraries, an AWS Server Key, and your Cloud Firestore credentials. Be sure to configure your BOT using the Discord developer portal.
